# Transformer in numpy.

Transformer written from scratch in numpy with manual backprop cuz why not.
This is not really meant to be used for anything serious as it runs on the CPU and is thus quite slow (although everything is fully vectorized in numpy so it's not that slow eitherðŸ˜Ž).

Install numpy:

`pip install numpy`

Optionally, to run train example notebook:

`pip install matplotlib ipykernel`
